To run the server, write "npm start" in terminal to start the server. 
Once server is started, you can save file with cmd/ctrl + S.
So you can get port link: "http://localhost:5000" in terminal.
You can click the link and view the website.

Moreover, I try to add node-modules folder in Gitub but it was not allowing me to import file due size isse.
